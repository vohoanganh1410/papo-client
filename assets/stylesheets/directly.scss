// Directly's Real Time Messaging (RTM) widget is an on-demand customer support tool.
// Read more about the RTM widget and how it's used in Calypso in the `lib/directly` README.
//
// The RTM widget loads in an iframe, so we can't adjust the widget's internal styles
// with the primary Calypso stylesheet. This file is bundled as a separate CSS file to be
// linked from inside the widget's iframe.
//
// We have two Directly builds — Production and Sandbox. Directly requires that all
// custom CSS files exist at a public web address, and these can't change on-the-fly
// based on the Calypso environment. So the CSS files Directly uses are hard-set to:
//
// Sandbox:    https://wpcalypso.wordpress.com/calypso/directly.css
// Production: https://wordpress.com/calypso/directly.css
//
// ## DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
//
// Calypso's development environment uses the Sandbox Directly build, which requests custom
// CSS from the wpcalypso server. This means that to see local CSS changes you'll need to
// make your browser rewrite those CSS URLs to the local version:
//
// https://wpcalypso.wordpress.com/calypso/directly.css -> http://calypso.localhost:3000/calypso/directly.css
//
// You can accomplish this using a browser extension such as Switcharoo Redirector
// for Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/switcheroo-redirector/cnmciclhnghalnpfhhleggldniplelbg
//
// An unfortunate side-effect is that the widget's iframe src is https, but this local
// CSS file is http. So most browsers will block the CSS by default to prevent mixed
// content. In order to see the custom CSS you will need to temporarily allow insecure
// content on the page. In Chrome for Mac you can issue this Terminal command:
//
// open -a Google\ Chrome --args --allow-running-insecure-content
//
// QUIT AND RESTART YOUR BROWSER NORMALLY WHEN YOU'RE DONE MAKING LOCAL CSS CHANGES.
